# Scoll a joke

Bored? Scroll a joke is here to save the day. Scroll endlessly up and down to enjoy a new joke.

This application is reliant on scroll functionality and API calls. Scrolling is faster than calling an external API, so scroll slow or wait a millisecond for the joke to render.

This application uses:
- React
- Boostrap
- axios
- react-icons
- react-scroll-motion
- react-popper-tooltip

### Getting started
